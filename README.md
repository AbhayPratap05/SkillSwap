# Skill Swap Platform

A web application that enables users to **list their skills**, **request others in return**, and **connect with like-minded individuals** for mutual learning and collaboration.

## üöÄ Overview

The Skill Swap Platform is designed to help users exchange skills in a collaborative, community-driven way. Users can create profiles, list what they can offer, and what they want to learn. The platform facilitates finding suitable matches and managing swap requests.
